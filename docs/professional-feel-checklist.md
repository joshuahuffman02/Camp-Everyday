# Professional Feel Checklist (Marketing + Product UX)

Goal: Make Campreserv feel as polished and intuitive as top-tier hospitality platforms.
Scope: Brand, marketing pages, and in-app UX (not tied to any single feature).

Use this as a QA list before launch and as a guiding rubric for new UI work.

## 1) Visual system consistency
- [ ] A defined typography pairing (headline + body) with a documented type scale.
- [ ] Color tokens for brand, neutrals, semantic states, and data viz.
- [ ] Consistent spacing scale (4/8/12/16/24/32/48/64).
- [ ] Grid and container widths defined per breakpoint.
- [ ] Buttons, inputs, tables, cards, modals, and alerts share a single design language.

## 2) Navigation and information architecture
- [ ] Primary nav groups match how operators think (Bookings, Ops, Guests, Revenue, Integrations).
- [ ] Each section has a clear landing page with a visible next step.
- [ ] Breadcrumbs or clear sub-nav for deep pages.
- [ ] Search is globally available (or obvious per major section).

## 3) Marketing page structure
- [ ] Each product page follows a consistent pattern: hero -> outcomes -> features -> proof -> FAQ -> CTA.
- [ ] Proof blocks (logos, stats, testimonials) appear above the fold or immediately after outcomes.
- [ ] One CTA per page section (no competing CTAs).
- [ ] Resources/FAQ provide just enough depth without burying the core story.

## 4) Copy system (tone, clarity, and intent)
- [ ] Headlines are benefit-first and plain-language.
- [ ] Every feature line answers "so what?" with a concrete operator outcome.
- [ ] Microcopy in forms is precise (what happens next, what is required, why).
- [ ] Error messages are actionable (what broke and how to fix it).

## 5) Trust and credibility
- [ ] Visible claims are quantified (saves time, reduces no-shows, increases direct bookings).
- [ ] Security/compliance posture stated plainly (PCI, SOC, GDPR if applicable).
- [ ] Partner and integration logos are real and current.
- [ ] Case studies show measurable results, not just quotes.

## 6) Conversion UX polish
- [ ] All CTAs have a single, predictable flow (no dead ends).
- [ ] Forms are short, progressive, and include validation feedback.
- [ ] Live scheduling or demo request feels premium (no generic forms).
- [ ] Lead capture is tracked end-to-end (GA4, GTM, CRM).

## 7) Product UX intuitiveness
- [ ] Default views are useful without configuration.
- [ ] Empty states include suggested actions (first booking, import, setup).
- [ ] Tasks are guided by wizards when they are multi-step.
- [ ] Filters are visible, persistent, and show active filter pills.
- [ ] Export is flexible (column pickers, saved presets, CSV/XLSX).
- [ ] Inline help exists for complex forms (tooltips or "Learn more").

## 8) Data clarity and reporting
- [ ] Dashboards answer the top 3 operator questions without drilling.
- [ ] Charts have clear labels, units, and date ranges.
- [ ] Reports can be exported without manual copy/paste.
- [ ] Audit trails exist for sensitive actions (rates, refunds, policies).

## 9) Performance and accessibility
- [ ] Core Web Vitals are in the green for public pages.
- [ ] Inputs and tables are keyboard friendly.
- [ ] Contrast and focus states are consistent and visible.
- [ ] Motion is purposeful and minimal (avoid gratuitous animation).

## 10) Release notes and product cadence
- [ ] Release notes have "New", "Update", "Enhancement" tags with dates.
- [ ] Each update includes: What changed, Why it matters, Who it helps.
- [ ] Major updates include short demo videos or screenshots.
- [ ] Public roadmap or changelog makes the product feel actively maintained.

## 11) Design QA before shipping
- [ ] Cross-browser check (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).
- [ ] Mobile layout reviewed for every major page.
- [ ] All primary flows tested with real data.
- [ ] No placeholder lorem text or missing images.

## Professional-feel signals from Cloudbeds updates (patterns to emulate)

These update themes create a "serious, mature product" feel:

- Explainable AI (rate recommendations include plain-language rationale and visual drivers).
- Consolidated performance dashboards (ads results merged across channels).
- Reporting upgrades (new data fields, improved export wizard, smarter filters).
- Policy automation (deposits, cancellation fees, auto-collection).
- Ops workflow improvements (document upload to group events).
- Broader integrations (auto-processing payments for more channels).
- Compliance controls (guest requirement enforcement by touchpoint).
- Channel sync controls (availability, rates, restrictions toggles).
- Google listing enhancements (images, rates, policies in listings).
- Review reminders (timely prompts for Airbnb and OTA reviews).

Use these as a checklist for "product maturity signals" in Campreserv.
